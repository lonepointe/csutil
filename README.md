# csutil

I was going to say something then I forgot what.
I should be learning laravel but i'm not.  I'm playing with this nonsense.

Still need the core functionality of timing things.
  db connection,
    new entry
    delete entry
    TODO: edit entry

  calculate boxes for given amount of time
    done, 
    TODO: but needs some kind of form to enter the time period.

  timer for boxes, skids
    TODO: I think this might be a javascript problem, and I don't know javascript.

this is the readme file.
I haven't done anything yet, so I guess this should be blank.
Dude, if anybody's reading this nonsense, this is just a vanity project 
that I'm just trying like hell to get to work.

I think I'm going to start with just the php functions to see if I can even get it to work to begin with.
Then I'll worry about more complex shit like the UI interface.
