this is the readme file.
I haven't done anything yet, so I guess this should be blank.
Dude, if anybody's reading this nonsense, this is just a vanity project 
that I'm just trying like hell to get to work.

I think I'm going to start with just the php functions to see if I can even get it to work to begin with.
Then I'll worry about more complex shit like the UI interface.
